# @ttoss/monorepo

`@ttoss/monorepo` is a helper package that helps you configure your monorepo. It wraps the packages that you would install in your root package.json in a such way that you only need to run `yarn ttoss-monorepo` to get a functional monorepo.

## Install

```bash
yarn add -DW @ttoss/monorepo
```

## Setup

To setup your entire monorepo, you just need to execute the following command:

```bash
yarn ttoss-monorepo
```
