# General Instructions

## Post-Change Validation

After completing any code changes, always run the following command to apply linting rules and ensure code quality:

```bash
pnpm run -w lint
```

This command:

- Applies consistent code formatting across the monorepo
- Identifies and fixes common code quality issues
- Ensures all changes comply with the project's linting standards

**Important**: Always run this command before considering your changes complete.
