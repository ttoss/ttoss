title: 'Agility in Action: Embracing Change Through Decentralized Product Decisions'
description: In the fast-paced world of product development, change is inevitable. This article explores the importance of initial planning while acknowledging that unforeseen challenges and opportunities will arise. It highlights how the dynamic nature of the market can render past data and assumptions obsolete, emphasizing the need for product teams to adapt quickly. By enabling decentralized decision-making, teams on the front lines—who often encounter new information first—can respond promptly to shifts in technology, customer needs, and competition. This approach allows organizations to stay agile, innovate, and turn unexpected challenges into strategic advantages.

In product development, initial planning is essential. We create roadmaps, set goals, and allocate resources based on the best data available at the time. However, it's critical to recognize that no plan can anticipate every problem or opportunity that lies ahead.

The plan is, by nature, a reflection of the information the team had at the moment of its creation. This information, while valuable, is subject to change as the market evolves. What was true at the time of planning may no longer hold in the face of new realities. The market is dynamic, constantly shifting with new customer needs, emerging technologies, and competitive pressures.

One of the key factors in navigating this uncertainty is the ability to react quickly to new data. The individuals at the front lines—whether it's an engineer discovering a breakthrough technology or a marketer identifying a new customer pain point—are the first to detect these changes. They are uniquely positioned to inform and drive necessary adjustments in strategy.

Responding quickly to these shifts is crucial to staying ahead of the competition and capitalizing on opportunities. For this reason, product teams must be empowered to make decentralized decisions. Rather than waiting for approvals from a complex hierarchy, the team closest to the problem or opportunity should have the autonomy to act.

Decentralized decision-making not only accelerates the response to market changes but also leverages the diverse expertise within the team. In this way, organizations can remain agile and innovative, turning unexpected challenges into advantages.

## Striking the Balance: Centralized vs. Decentralized Decision-Making

In product development, the debate often revolves around whether a team should operate with fully centralized control or embrace complete decentralization. However, the reality is that successful teams don't need to choose one extreme over the other. Instead, they benefit from finding a balance between the two approaches.

Centralization can be valuable for overarching strategies, long-term vision, and ensuring alignment across the organization. It ensures that critical decisions—especially those involving significant resources or high risks—are made with a broader perspective in mind. On the other hand, decentralization empowers the team to act swiftly on emerging opportunities and respond to immediate challenges without waiting for approval from higher levels.

We're collecting a [set of principles that guide our product development process to achieve this balance](/docs/product/product-development/principles#achieving-decentralized-control). These principles help us navigate the tension between centralized and decentralized control, ensuring that we can adapt to change while maintaining a clear strategic direction. Two of them are:
