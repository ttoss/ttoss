Welcome to ttoss, a tech company we created to improve efficiency and effectiveness in product development. Building products can be complex and time-consuming, and we want to help your business remove waste and streamline its operations. We can help your business achieve its goals and succeed in today's competitive market by providing the right tools and resources.

To achieve this, we created a variety of products, including principles and proper processes for [operations departments](https://arantespp.com/zettel/operations-departments-of-a-tech-company); Modules, a library of modules for web application development; and carlin, a command-line interface (CLI) for easy app deployment and automation.

It's important to note that they're highly opinionated solutions. By taking a narrower approach, we could provide targeted solutions that we designed to work together in harmony.

## Operations Departments

We understand that having clear and well-documented processes is crucial for ensuring that operations departments and cross-functional teams work smoothly and effectively. That's why we have developed a set of principles and guidelines for each department, including engineering, design, marketing, sales, customer success, product, and operations. These documents provide clear direction and guidance for your teams, helping them to deliver top-quality support and solutions to your clients.

In addition to improving the departmental, these guidelines help your cross-functional teams work seamlessly together. It enables your teams to collaborate and communicate efficiently, ensuring that all members are on the same page and working towards a common goal. As a result, you can provide your clients with the best possible support and solutions by streamlining your processes and enabling effective communication.

## Modules

One of the key products offered by ttoss is our library of modules for web application development. We designed this library to help developers save time and effort when building and improving web apps while still delivering high-quality, custom solutions.

One of the main advantages of Modules is the harmony you achieve when using the modules together. By leveraging the full range of modules in our library, developers can take advantage of pre-built components and functionality, allowing them to focus on delivering real value to their clients instead of spending time on the more tedious aspects of app development. For example, the UI library theme provides the styles for all other modules, you only need to set the application theme, and the rest is done for you.

The main goal of Modules is to leverage development time and help businesses focus on their clients. Furthermore, by providing building block solutions that are easy to integrate into existing web apps, we aim to help companies to streamline their operations and improve their digital products.

## carlin

carlin is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that we created to handle all engineering automation. With carlin, you can quickly build and deploy their apps with just a few simple commands, saving valuable time and effort. One of the key benefits of carlin is that it streamlines the deployment process, making it quick and easy to get your apps up and running with a reliable, user-friendly, and simple interface.
