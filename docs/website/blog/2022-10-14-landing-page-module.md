Today we started our Landing Page module project. Our cross-functional team projected this module, that is a library of React components for building landing pages. The marketing team has studied the market and the customers and defined the sections contained in landing pages. The design team has created the visual components together with the whole landing page. The engineering team implemented the [@ttoss/landing-pages](https://ttoss.dev/docs/modules/packages/landing-pages/) package.
