One of the core objectives of **ttoss** (Terezinha Tech Operations) is to create a modular library system that enables product development teams to become agile, aligning with the [Principle D12: The Second Agility Principle](/docs/product/product-development/principles#d12-the-second-agility-principle-develop-the-ability-to-quickly-shift-focus). In today's fast-moving development world, the ability to pivot and adapt rapidly is crucial. This principle emphasizes that it's not enough to merely decide to change direction—teams must be able to execute those changes quickly and efficiently.

**ttoss** addresses this need by providing a collection of ready-to-use [modules](/docs/modules/), published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), that handle common functionalities in product development. By leveraging these pre-built modules, development teams can streamline their work and focus on what matters most: delivering features that drive customer value.

Here are some examples of packages available in the **ttoss** [modules](/docs/modules/):

- [graphql-api](/docs/modules/packages/graphql-api/): This module facilitates the creation of GraphQL APIs in Node.js projects. By using graphql-api, teams can quickly set up GraphQL endpoints, enabling them to build scalable and flexible APIs without reinventing the wheel.

- [react-auth-core](/docs/modules/packages/react-auth-core/): This module provides a solution for user authentication in React applications. It helps teams implement secure authentication processes, so they can focus on developing user-facing features rather than managing authentication logic.

- [react-i18n](/docs/modules/packages/react-i18n/): This package simplifies internationalization (i18n) in React projects. By using react-i18n, teams can easily implement localization, ensuring their applications are accessible to a global audience without getting bogged down in the complexities of i18n.

- [test-utils](/docs/modules/packages/test-utils/): This package provides utility functions for testing Node.js applications. It helps teams write tests more efficiently, ensuring code quality while minimizing the time spent on testing.

- [ui](/docs/modules/packages/ui/): The ui package offers a collection of pre-built user interface components. By using these components, teams can maintain consistency in design and reduce the time spent on UI development, allowing them to prioritize enhancing user experience.

In line with [Principle FF10: The First Agility Principle](/docs/product/product-development/principles#ff10-the-first-agility-principle-we-dont-need-long-planning-horizons-when-we-have-a-short-turning-radius)—"We Don't Need Long Planning Horizons when We Have a Short Turning Radius"**ttoss** is designed to reduce the "mass" of projects. It minimizes the burden on development teams by offering lightweight, flexible modules that can be easily integrated, adapted, or replaced as needed. This shorter "turning radius" allows teams to operate with agility and confidence, even in rapidly changing environments.

By building and expanding the **ttoss** library, the goal is to empower development teams to activate agility in their workflows, ensuring they can shift focus quickly, adapt to new information, and maintain efficiency throughout the product development lifecycle. By adopting this modular approach, teams can reduce overhead, maintain flexibility, and concentrate on what matters most—delivering exceptional products that meet customer needs.

In addition to the key packages mentioned, **ttoss** offers comprehensive documentation on the operations involved in digital product development across [product management](/docs/product), [engineering](/docs/engineering), and [design](/docs/engineering) departments. This additional resource ensures that teams not only have access to reusable modules but also a clear understanding of best practices and processes that enhance collaboration and efficiency. By providing both modular solutions and operational insights, **ttoss** is committed to supporting teams in every aspect of their product development work.
