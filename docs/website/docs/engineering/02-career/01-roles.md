title: Roles
---

People can assume specific roles on the engineering team accordingly to their skills, experience, and responsibilities. Today, we have six positions: [Intern](#intern), [Junior Full Stack Developer](#junior-full-stack-developer), [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer), [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer), [Tech Lead](#tech-lead), and [CTO](#cto).

Before diving into each role's details, we need to understand common responsibilities and expectations for all positions.

Working with us may be good for you if you:

- **Want to work on our [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies).** We chose our stack considering some market and engineering characteristics and decided to become experts on it. We concluded our stack is the best option for us to build our products and deliver value to our customers.
- **Know how to manage yourself.** We don't micro-manage our team, except if you're a new team member and are still learning to work with us. We trust you to do your job, and we expect you to be responsible for your work once we provide the project's vision and goals.
- **Enjoy working with our [workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow).** We created a workflow based on [Flow](https://arantespp.com/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow), [Agile](/zettel/agile), Lean, and [Kanban](/zettel/kanban) principles.

Working with us **MAY NOT** be good for you if you:

- **Want a job that deals only with coding.** Our main goal is to deliver value to our customers; we rely on cross-functionality to achieve that. Besides coding, you must be comfortable understanding the customer's needs, proposing different solutions and new ideas, and interacting with cross-functional team members.
- **Don't like to change projects often.** As we started as a software house and became a [venture building](https://arantespp.com/zettel/startup-studio), we may change projects often to test new ideas and validate markets.
- **Don't like our work [tools](/docs/engineering/onboarding#tools).** You'll have a poor experience if you don't like our tools—GitHub, ClickUp, Slack, and AWS.

### Tasks

A list of tasks that are common to all positions:

- **Write code.** Write code with quality, following our [guidelines](/docs/engineering/guidelines), with tests, and documentation when necessary.
- **Review Pull Requests.** Review your teammates' code and provide feedback to improve the code quality.
- **Follow the entire [task cycle](/docs/engineering/workflow/kanban#teams-high-level-routine).** From the moment you receive a task until the moment you deliver it to production, you must follow and guarantee its whole cycle.

## Roles

### Intern

**_Requisites:_** Undergraduate students of any TI course.

Undergraduate students that don't have experience with software development.

### Junior Full Stack Developer

**_Requisites:_** Git and basic knowledge of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/).

They assume more straightforward tasks because they're still learning, gaining experience in the software development field (they may have zero experience), or learning our company's technologies. Therefore, they have low responsibility for the projects.

### Mid-Level Full Stack Developer

**_Requisites:_** [Junior Full Stack Developer](#junior-full-stack-developer) requisites and experience with [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/) advanced, GraphQL, TypeScript, and AWS.

They have more experience and higher knowledge and assume more complex tasks, from the backend to the frontend. They also know most of our company's [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies) and take on project responsibilities.

Mid-Level Software developers have two directions for career progression: [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer) for a technical (keep coding career) or [Tech Lead](#tech-lead) for management and leadership paths.

### Senior Full Stack Developer

**_Requisites:_** [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer) requisites and experience implementing and architecting complex solutions.

Senior Software Developers can assume any task and manage and architect any project. They take on higher responsibilities on projects.

### Tech Lead

The Tech Lead is usually the leader of a small number of developers. They act as mentors, examples, and guides for the rest of the team. In addition, they're responsible for the team's code quality measures, such as ensuring that the group conducts good code reviews and follows the company's technical standards.

### CTO

The CTO has a vision of the engineering department's future and participates in business decisions.
