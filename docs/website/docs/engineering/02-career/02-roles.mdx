## Intern

**_Requisites:_** Undergraduate students of any IT course.

Undergraduate students that don't have experience with software development.

## Junior Full Stack Developer

Junior Full Stack Developers are responsible for learning our [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies) and our [workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow). They are expected to work on our projects and become a [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer).

### Scope

- **Responsibility**: Can be responsible for a specific module within a part of the application, such as a specific feature in the frontend, a simple route in the API, or a set of queries in the database.
- **Example**: Implement the contact form interface on the frontend, create a simple endpoint in the API to receive form data, or develop basic database queries to support this feature.

### Technical Skills

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/).
- Basic knowledge of frontend, backend development, and databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
- Basic understanding of version control using Git.

### Responsibilities

- Implement simple tasks under direct supervision.
- Fix bugs and make small improvements to existing code.
- Write basic tests to ensure code functionality.

## Mid-Level Full Stack Developer

They have more experience and higher knowledge and assume more complex tasks, from the backend to the frontend. They also know most of our company's [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies) and take responsibility for part of the projects.

Mid-Level developers have two directions for career progression: [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer) for a technical (keep coding career) or [Tech Lead](#tech-lead) for management and leadership paths.

### Scope

- **Responsibility**: Can be responsible for a complete part of the application, such as the entire frontend, the entire API, or the entire database layer.
- **Example**: Develop and maintain the entire frontend of the application, including integrating with the API and implementing complex components. Alternatively, be responsible for the entire API, ensuring all routes work correctly and efficiently, or manage the database, including data modeling and query optimization.

### Technical Skills

- Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Proficient in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/).
- Solid knowledge of backend development and API integration.
- Skill in responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
- Experience with version control and collaborative development practices.

### Responsibilities

- Develop complete and complex features independently.
- Review and maintain code, ensuring high quality and efficiency.
- Actively participate in code reviews, providing constructive feedback.
- Collaborate with the product team (managers, designers and others engineers) to implement new features.

### Autonomy

- Ability to work independently with minimal supervision.
