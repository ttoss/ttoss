People can assume specific roles on the engineering team accordingly to their skills, experience, and responsibilities. Today, we have six positions: [Intern](#intern), [Junior Full Stack Developer](#junior-full-stack-developer), [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer), [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer), [Tech Lead](#tech-lead), and [CTO](#cto).

## Roles

### Intern

**_Requisites:_** Undergraduate students of any IT course.

Undergraduate students that don't have experience with software development.

### Junior Full Stack Developer

<JuniorFfullStackDeveloperRequisites />

They assume more straightforward tasks because they're still learning, gaining experience in the software development field (they may have zero experience), or learning our company's [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies). Therefore, they have low responsibility for the projects.

### Mid-Level Full Stack Developer

<MidLevelFullStackDeveloperRequisites />

They have more experience and higher knowledge and assume more complex tasks, from the backend to the frontend. They also know most of our company's [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies) and take responsibility for part of the projects.

Mid-Level Software developers have two directions for career progression: [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer) for a technical (keep coding career) or [Tech Lead](#tech-lead) for management and leadership paths.

### Senior Full Stack Developer

They can assume tasks of any complexity and work on defining the project's architectures. They take full responsibility for projects.

### Tech Lead

The Tech Lead is usually the leader of a small number of developers. They act as mentors, examples, and guides for the rest of the team. In addition, they're responsible for the team's code quality measures, such as ensuring that the group conducts good code reviews and follows the company's technical standards.

### CTO

The CTO has a vision of the engineering department's future and participates in business decisions.
