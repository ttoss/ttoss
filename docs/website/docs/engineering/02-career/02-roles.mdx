People can assume specific roles on the engineering team accordingly to their skills, experience, and responsibilities. We have the positions:

- [Intern](#intern)
- [Junior Full Stack Developer](#junior-full-stack-developer)
- [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer)
- [Senior Full Stack Developer](#senior-full-stack-developer)
- [Tech Lead](#tech-lead).

:::tip Culture

It's essential that you feel comfortable with our [working culture](/docs/engineering/career/culture).

:::

## Intern

**_Requisites:_** Undergraduate students of any IT course.

Undergraduate students that don't have experience with software development.

## Junior Full Stack Developer

Junior Full Stack Developers are responsible for learning our [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies) and our [workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow). They are expected to work on our projects and become a [Mid-Level Full Stack Developer](#mid-level-full-stack-developer).

### Scope

- **Responsibility**: Can be responsible for a specific module within a part of the application, such as a specific feature in the frontend, a simple route in the API, or a set of queries in the database.
- **Example**: Implement the contact form interface on the frontend, create a simple endpoint in the API to receive form data, or develop basic database queries to support this feature.

### Technical Skills

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/).
- Basic knowledge of frontend, backend development, and databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
- Basic understanding of version control using Git.

### Responsibilities
