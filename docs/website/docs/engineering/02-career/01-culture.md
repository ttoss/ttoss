Working with us may be good for you if you:

- **Want to work on our [technologies stack](/docs/engineering/technologies).** We chose our stack considering some market and engineering characteristics and decided to become experts on it. We concluded our stack is the best option for us to build our products and deliver value to our customers.
- **Know how to manage yourself.** We don't micro-manage our team, except if you're a new team member and are still learning to work with us. We trust you to do your job, and we expect you to be responsible for your work once we provide the project's vision and goals.
- **Enjoy working with our [workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow).** We created a workflow based on [Flow](https://arantespp.com/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow), [Agile](https://arantespp.com/zettel/agile), Lean, and [Kanban](https://arantespp.com/zettel/kanban) principles.

Working with us **MAY NOT** be good for you if you:

- **Want a job that deals only with coding.** Our main goal is to deliver value to our customers; we rely on cross-functionality to achieve that. Besides coding, you must be comfortable understanding the customer's needs, proposing different solutions and new ideas, and interacting with cross-functional team members.
- **Don't like to change projects often.** As we started as a software house and became a [venture building](https://arantespp.com/zettel/startup-studio), we may change projects often to test new ideas and validate markets.
- **Don't like our work [tools](/docs/engineering/onboarding#tools).** You'll have a poor experience if you don't like our toolsâ€”GitHub, ClickUp, Slack, and AWS.

Don't forget that we'll always provide you with the tools, support, and environment to do your job.

- **Write code.** Write code with quality, following our [guidelines](/docs/engineering/guidelines), with tests, and documentation when necessary.
- **Review Pull Requests.** Review your teammates' code and provide feedback to improve the code quality.
- **Follow the entire [task cycle](/docs/engineering/workflow/kanban#teams-high-level-routine).** From the moment you receive a task until the moment you deliver it to production, you must follow and guarantee its whole cycle.
