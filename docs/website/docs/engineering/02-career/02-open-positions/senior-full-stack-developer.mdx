## Job description

We're looking for a [Senior Full Stack Developer](/docs/engineering/career/roles#senior-full-stack-developer) to build products with us. [Tri√¢ngulos Tecnologia](https://www.triangulostecnologia.com/?lang=en) is a product-house in the process of becoming a venture building. Our primary focus is on the products we make, the value we generate for our customers, and not only the engineering itself. Because of this, we expect you to enjoy working not only as a software developer but also as a product developer (of course, with our support).

## What we expect from you

As a [Senior Full Stack Developer](/docs/engineering/career/roles#senior-full-stack-developer), we expect from you:

1. To be transparent, expose your ideas and opinions, and be open to feedback, helping our team to grow.

1. Handle entire projects from transforming an idea into a product, to its deployment and maintenance. This includes:

   1. Designing the product's architecture, including the database, the APIs, and the frontend.

   2. Building the product, including the APIs, the frontend, and the database.

   3. Deploying and monitoring the product to customers.

   4. Maintaining the product and removing technical debt.

1. Propose improvements to our engineering practices, guidelines, and [workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow), including our development process, code quality, testing, deployment, and monitoring practices.

1. Define reusable code patterns and libraries from our projects to add as a building block to our [Modules project](/docs/modules/).

:::tip Culture

It's essential that you feel comfortable with our [working culture](/docs/engineering/career/roles#commons), and that you resonates with our [mission, vision, and values](https://github.com/TriangulosTecnologia/TriangulosTecnologia/blob/main/mission-vision-values.md).
