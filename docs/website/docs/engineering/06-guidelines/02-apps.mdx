## React Components

- Component name should be in PascalCase.
- Use named export to export the component (`export const MyComponent = () => ...`).
- Components should have a folder with the same name.
  - Component file should have the same name (`MyComponent/MyComponent.tsx`).
  - Don't use `index` files.
