## Statuses

- [Sorting](#sorting)
- [Working](#working)
- [Blocked](#blocked)
- [Done](#done)
- [Canceled](#canceled)

### Sorting

This status represents the stories and tasks that the team should do someday. It includes PM stories she creates because of her research and talks with customers.

### Working

With the cadence of one week, the product team (PM, engineering, design, marketing) decides which stories or tasks they'll work on. Once they decide on the tasks, they change the status of the tasks to Working. The best practice is every team member gets only one story to work on to limit their WIP.

### Blocked

Something external from the product team is blocking the task.

### Done

The person working on the task (engineer, designer, marketer) should move it to Done once he finishes. Before moving to Done, he should consult every team member to review and approve the task. This way, we won't need a second approval once the task finishes, and we give ownership and responsibility to the task owner.

### Canceled

The story or task is canceled, mainly because the market doesn't want that feature.
