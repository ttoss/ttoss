## ClickUp

We use ClickUp to track the progress of our work.

### Statuses

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Sorting" />

This status represents the stories and tasks that the team should do someday or that the team needs to do more research before starting.

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Ready to Start" />

With the cadence of one week, the product team decides which stories and tasks they'll work on next. Once they choose them, the status changes to "Ready to Start."

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Working" />

The stories that each member is working on. The best practice is each team member gets only one story to work on to limit their WIP.

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Blocked" />

Something external from the product team is blocking the task.

##### Examples of blocked tasks:

- The team is waiting for a decision of a stakeholder.

##### Example of NOT blocked tasks:

- The task owner is waiting for the code review from some team members.

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Canceled" />

The team cancels the story, mainly because the market doesn't want that feature.

#### <ClickUpStatus status="Closed" />

The person working on the task has the ownership and responsibility to move to this status once she finishes. However, before closing the job, she may want to consult every team member to review and approve the implementation.
