To work in our engineering team, you need to get access to the following apps:

## Slack

Our main chat App for the team.

## GitHub

Where we store the code of our projects.

## ClickUp

As a cross-functional team, we use the **ClickUp** platform to manage the project stories and tasks.

## AWS

AWS is our official cloud provider. For each project, we have a dedicated AWS account that handle the cloud infrastructure of the project. Depending on your level of expertise or your participation in a specific project, you can access the production AWS account as a **developer** or as a read-only **viewer**.

We also have a sandbox AWS account that we use to develop our projects and deploy the Staging environment. You should have access to this account if you belong to the engineering team.

### Types of Access

#### User and Password

For the sandbox account, you'll have this type of access. The advantage of this method compared with [AWS Single Sign-On](#aws-single-sign-on) is that you can sing in once and can save the AWS credentials in your computer.

#### AWS Single Sign-On

We use [AWS Single Sign-On](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) to manage the access to our AWS organizationâ€”then all AWS accounts. The main advantage of this method is that you need to have a single account in the organization, and you can access to all AWS accounts that you have access to.

The disadvantage is that you to sign in every time if you want to access the Console or get the AWS credentials.
