To work in our engineering team, you need to get access to the following apps:

## Slack

Our main chat App for the team.

## GitHub

Where we store the code of our projects.

## ClickUp

As a cross-functional team, we use the **ClickUp** platform to manage the project stories and tasks.

## AWS

AWS is our official cloud provider. For each project, we have a dedicated AWS account that handle the cloud infrastructure of the project. Depending on your level of expertise or your participation in a specific project, you can access the production AWS account as a **developer** or as a read-only **viewer**.

We also have a sandbox AWS account that we use to develop our projects and deploy the Staging environment. You should have access to this account if you belong to the engineering team.
