title: Kanban
---

We use the [Kanban](https://arantespp.com/zettel/kanban) to delivery high-quality value to our customers, on time and on budget.
We chose [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) as our project management tool because it enables our cross-functional teams to work together in a single place, and share the entire project lifecycle with every team member.

## Team's high-level routine

The engineering team follow a high-level routine for producing value to our customers, whose steps are:

### Backlog

We add not started tasks to the engineering backlog. These tasks come from design, product, or other teams or new substasks.

### Specify

We specify the work necessary to complete the task. Generally, we split the task into smaller tasks that can be completed in a single day. We also add the new subtasks to the backlog.

### Implement

We implement the task, together with tests, technical or customer documentation, and other necessary artifacts. We also check if it meets the requirements on development environment.

### Deploy

We release the work to Staging and Production environments. We also check if the implementation works properly on these environments.

## Kanban board

Now that we defined the [team's high-level routine](#teams-high-level-routine), let's define the statuses of the Kanban board and the rules for moving tasks between them.

### Statuses

The Kanban board has the following statuses.

| Status           | High-level routine      | Description                                                                                                                   | Done Rules                                               | WIP Limit |

## Rules

### WIP Limits

The work in process (WIP) limits in each [high-level routine](#teams-high-level-routine) has two main roles. First, they limit the amount of work affected by changing priorities, requirements, or design, which is the core of [business agility](https://arantespp.com/zettel/business-agility). Second, WIP limits restrict the flow of work to match the pace of the slowest step ([Implement](#implement)), also known as constraint. Pacing the other steps to match it yields high efficiency and productivity because you can't complete work faster than the constraint.
