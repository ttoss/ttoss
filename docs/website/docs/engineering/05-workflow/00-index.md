# Engineering Workflow

Welcome to the ttoss engineering workflow documentation. This workflow is specifically focused on **technical implementation** and **software delivery**, complementing the [product workflow](/docs/product/workflow) which handles strategy and feature definition.

## Overview

Our engineering process is based on agility and velocity principles, as described in [First, We Aim for Velocity](/blog/2024/12/17/first-we-aim-for-velocity-driving-fast-and-adaptive-product-development). We use modern practices like **Trunk-Based Development** and **Continuous Deployment** to ensure fast and reliable deliveries.

## Workflow Structure

### 1. [Goals](./goals)

Objectives and principles that guide our technical development process.

### 2. [Development Process](./development-process)

Detailed process from task assignment to production monitoring.

## Differences Between Product and Engineering Workflows

| Aspect               | Product                                    | Engineering                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Focus**            | Strategy, discovery, definition            | Technical implementation, delivery |
| **Responsibilities** | What to build, why to build                | How to build, when to deliver      |
| **Tools**            | ClickUp, user research, analysis           | GitHub, CI/CD, monitoring          |
| **Outputs**          | User stories, requirements, prioritization | Code, deployments, features        |
| **Metrics**          | Product KPIs, user satisfaction            | Cycle time, code quality           |

## Integration Points

The workflows connect at specific moments:

- **Task assignment**: Engineering receives tasks defined by product
- **Technical feedback**: Engineering informs about feasibility and effort
- **Delivery validation**: Confirmation that product criteria were met
- **Metrics monitoring**: Joint tracking of KPIs

## Next Steps

For developers starting the process:

1. Read the [Goals](./goals) to understand the principles
2. Study the [Development Process](./development-process) for the complete process
3. Check the [onboarding documentation](/docs/engineering/onboarding) for initial setup
4. See the [technologies used](/docs/engineering/technologies) in our projects
