## Weekly

### Goals

The main goal of weekly meetings is to align the company’s vision with the team and the work we need to do to reach it in the next 7 days. We also use it to discuss if someone is blocked and needs some help.

At the end of the meeting, everyone can answer the questions:

- What are the desired long-term results of our company's efforts?
- What do I need to do this week to achieve these results?
- If I’m blocked, do I expose it clearly to the team, and do I have someone to support me?

### Duration

Maximum of 15 minutes. We don’t need more than this time to align the vision and the weekly work priorities.

### Don’ts

We don’t use this meeting to:

- **Discuss specific details of implementation.** Each team member should schedule different appointments with their respective leads to discuss specific domain details.
- **Discuss blocking issues.** The blocked person will discuss it with the leads in another meeting.
- **Status report.** We don’t need to do status reports because the Kanban boards already provide them.
