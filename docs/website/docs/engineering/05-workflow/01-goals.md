## Engineering Workflow Goals

The main objective of our engineering workflow is to implement technical solutions efficiently, maintaining high quality and delivery velocity. Our specific goals are:

### Velocity and Agility

- **Fast development cycles**: Enable multiple deployments per day when necessary
- **Fast feedback**: Identify problems as early as possible in the process
- **Bottleneck reduction**: Minimize waiting time between development and production

### Quality and Reliability

- **Reviewed code**: All code goes through review before production
- **Automated testing**: Ensure functionality through testing
- **Continuous monitoring**: Monitor applications in production

### Autonomy and Responsibility

- **Autonomous developers**: Ability to make technical decisions
- **End-to-end responsibility**: Monitor code from development to production
- **Continuous improvement**: Constant process evolution based on learnings

### Efficient Integration

- **Trunk-Based Development**: Continuous integration with main branch
- **Automated deployment**: Reduction of manual intervention in deployments
- **Effective collaboration**: Facilitate team communication and collaboration

### Separation of Responsibilities

This engineering workflow focuses specifically on **technical implementation**, while the [product workflow](/docs/product/workflow) handles **strategy and definition** of features. This separation allows:

- **Specialization**: Each team focuses on their area of expertise
- **Role clarity**: Well-defined responsibilities
- **Efficiency**: Processes optimized for each context
- **Natural integration**: Clear connection points between product and engineering
