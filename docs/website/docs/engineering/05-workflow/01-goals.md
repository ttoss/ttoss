title: Goals
---

The main goal of our workflow is to make it easy to apply [principles of product development](/docs/product/product-development/principles) to the engineering process of building products. We also want to balance creating a flexible approach to eliminate waste on low-value tasks and allowing our team to focus on high-value and creative tasks. Because of this, we have a few goals for our workflow:

- Gives the team a clear vision of the product.
- Help the team visualize the progress of the entire chain.
- Focus on the team members and not on the managers.
- The workflow should fit all members of the cross-functional product teamâ€”product managers, designers, marketers, and engineers.
- Each team member has the autonomy to complete, give suggestions, and decide on the product.
