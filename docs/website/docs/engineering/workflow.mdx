## Goals

We've created our workflow to achieve some goals to improve our product delivery.

- Gives the team a clear vision of the product.
- Help the team visualize the progress of the entire chain.

## Fundamentals

- Focus on the team members and not on the managers.
- The workflow should fit all members of the cross-functional product team—product managers, designers, marketers, and engineers.
- Each team member has the autonomy to complete, give suggestions, and decide on the tasks.

## Workflow

We use the Kanban framework to track our tasks, backlog items, and user stories.
ClickUp is our project management platform because it enables the cross-functional team to use the same tool.

The basis of the engineering workflow is the [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) branch model.
Using [release from trunk](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/release-from-trunk/) strategy, we continuously deliver value to customers.
To achieve this with quality, we follow:

- Every task should have its tests and documentation, if needed.
- Engineers should release small pieces of code every day as PR on GitHub. It also helps the team to give feedback and perform code reviews.

### CI/CD

Our entire CICD pipeline is automated (powered by [carlin](/docs/carlin/commands/deploy-cicd)), so we don't need to worry about
the manual release, test validations, and deployment in any environment—Development, Staging, or Production.
