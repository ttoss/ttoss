Welcome to the team! This page is a guide to help you get started with the engineering team.

We have two main goals for this page. The first is to help you get started with the team and the company, get access with the tools we use, present our workflow and our culture. The second is that you can setup your environment and start contributing to the team since the first day.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help you.

## Our main goal

**Our main goal with this guide is to help you submit your first pull request to the team repository.**

## Tools

You need to get access to the following apps:

| App         | Description                                                                                           | Checklist                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Discord     | Our main chat App for the team.                                                                       | -                                                |
| GitHub      | Where we store the codebase.                                                                          | - Be a member of Engineering team.               |
| ClickUp     | Project management tool.                                                                              | - Be a member of Product team.                   |
| AWS Sandbox | We have a sandbox AWS account that we use to develop our projects and deploy the Staging environment. | - Have access to [AWS SSO](#aws-single-sign-on). |

### AWS Single Sign-On

We use [AWS Single Sign-On](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) to manage the access to our AWS organization, so all AWS accounts. The main advantage of this method is that you can access all AWS accounts with a single login.

## Coding

Once you have access to the tools, you can start coding. Your [tech lead](/docs/engineering/career/roles#tech-lead) will help you to setup your environment and guide you through the first steps of our [workflow](/docs/product/workflow).

## Improving our process

We are always looking for ways to improve our process. If you have any suggestions, don't hesitate to share them with the team.
