title: 22-07-28 - Tests Folder
---

## Proposal

What about using a unique folder for all tests as [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/test) does? The `test` folder would be at the same level of the `src` folder.

### Pros

- Centralize all tests—unit, integration, e2e...—in one folder.

### Cons

- Unit tests would be distant from the related code.
