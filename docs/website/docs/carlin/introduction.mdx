This project has been built since 2018 as helpers scripts that we in our
engineering processes, from making AWS deployments to handling environment
variables. We created the first scripts to deploy CloudFormation templates as
we've started performing numerous deployments along with staging, production and
development environments.

As the scripts grew, we've decided to put them all in a CLI and to publish as a [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carlin) to allow the whole team uses it in all projects. We've decided to name the package as <Carlin />.

We've changed <Carlin /> API at least five times, always trying to provide the best API as possible. Currently, <Carlin /> has a stable API, and, for that reason, we've decided to open-source it, joining as a [ttoss](https://ttoss.dev) project.

## Should you use <Carlin /> in production?

**It depends**. We've been using it for a long time, and it suits us very well in our projects. We recommend using it if you have these two conditions:

1. **You know all <Carlin /> algorithms.**

2. **You know how to fix a deployment manually if some error occurs.**

## Testing coverage

Tests are critical to <Carlin /> because it's present in 100% of our projects. Currently, our [tests coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) threshold is:

<CodeBlock className="json">{testsCoverageThreshold}</CodeBlock>
