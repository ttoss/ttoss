# Artificial Intelligence at ttoss

This section explains how product teams at ttoss can use AI tools to accelerate learning, improve decisions, and ship higher-value features faster. We focus on practical integration points across discovery, design, engineering, and release workflows so AI becomes an amplifying capability—not a distraction.

## This is not:

- About training models or dataset engineering (we don't cover fine-tuning or retraining workflows).
- About model architectures or internals (no deep dives into transformers, layers, or research).
- About GPUs, cluster setup, or low-level infra tuning (hardware and performance engineering is out of scope).
