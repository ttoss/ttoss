Here are the principles that we follow when developing products. We use these principles as a base to create all processes, tools, guidelines, and workflows of all departmentsâ€”[product](/docs/product), marketing, design, and [engineering](/docs/engineering).

_We based on the book [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://arantespp.com/books/the-principles-of-product-development-flow) by Donald G. Reinertsen._

## Managing Queues

### The Principle of Invisible Inventory

Inventory in product development isn't physical objects but information. Then, it's virtually invisible, both physically and financially. Product development inventory's effects: increased [cycle time](https://arantespp.com/zettel/cycle-time), delayed feedback, constantly shifting priorities, and status reporting.

## Achieving Decentralized Control

### The Frequency Response Principle

We need to accelerate your decision-making speed and we do this involving few people and few layers of management. We must avoid overloading the limited bandwidth at high management levels by ensuring that low levels can correctly make most decisions.

We need to give tp the team authority, information, and practice to enable lower organization levels to make decisions. Without preparation and the freedom to fail upon occasion, they won't take control of these decisions.
