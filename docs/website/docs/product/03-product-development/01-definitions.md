Some definitions for product development.

## Cost of Delay

Cost of delay refers to the negative impact on a business that results from postponing the release or completion of a product, feature, or project. It encompasses several dimensions:

**Revenue Loss**: The potential income that the company misses out on while the product is delayed. This can be especially significant if the product was intended to capitalize on a specific market opportunity or seasonal demand.

**Opportunity Costs**: The value of other potential opportunities that are lost because resources are tied up with the delayed project. This could include the chance to work on more profitable projects or to enter new markets.

**Competitive Disadvantage**: Delays can allow competitors to release similar products first, potentially capturing market share and reducing the impact of your offering when it eventually launches.

**Increased Costs**: Delays can lead to additional costs such as extended development time, additional labor, and higher expenses for maintaining project momentum or adapting to changing market conditions.

**Reputation Impact**: Persistent delays can harm the company's reputation with customers, investors, and partners, potentially affecting future business opportunities and relationships.

In essence, the cost of delay quantifies the broader impact of project delays on a company’s financial performance, market position, and strategic goals.

### Example

Imagine a technology company is developing a new software product with two potential features to add:

- **Feature A**: A complex new functionality that customers are excited about, but which will take 4 weeks to develop.
- **Feature B**: A simpler but still valuable functionality that can be completed in 2 weeks.

#### Data

- **Expected daily revenue increase with Feature A (after launch)**: $10,000.
- **Expected daily revenue increase with Feature B (after launch)**: $6,000.
- **Cost of delay**:
  - Feature A: \$10,000/day × 28 days (development time) = \$280,000.
  - Feature B: \$6,000/day × 14 days (development time) = \$84,000.

#### Analysis

1. **Feature A**:

   - Time to complete: 28 days.
   - Additional revenue per day: \$10,000.
   - Total cost of delay: \$280,000.

1. **Feature B**:

   - Time to complete: 14 days.
   - Additional revenue per day: \$6,000.
   - Total cost of delay: \$84,000.

#### Decision

- **Feature A** has a higher potential revenue impact but also comes with a higher cost of delay. If the company chooses Feature A, the delay costs them $280,000, and it will take longer to start earning additional revenue.
- **Feature B** has a lower cost of delay and can start generating additional revenue sooner, costing only $84,000 in delay.

#### Conclusion

If the company prioritizes immediate revenue and lower risk, **Feature B** might be the better choice despite the lower potential revenue. However, if the company can afford the delay and is focused on maximizing long-term revenue, **Feature A** might be more beneficial despite its higher cost of delay.
