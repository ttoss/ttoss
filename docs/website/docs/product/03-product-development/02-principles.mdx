In this section, we list the principles that we follow when developing products. We use these principles as a base to create all processes, tools, guidelines, and workflows of all departments—[product](/docs/product), [design](/docs/engineering), and [engineering](/docs/engineering).

_We based on the book [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B00K7OWG7O) by Donald G. Reinertsen._

## The Economic View

_Why do you want to change the product development process?_ The answer: **to increase profits**.

The economic view of product development allows you to make product development decisions based on economic choices. You don't chase the popular proxy variable of the moment. Instead, you transform all proxy variables to the same unit of measure, life-cycle profits, and make multivariable trade-offs to increase profits, which is the core of product development.

### E1: The Principle of Quantified Overall Economics: Select Actions Based on Quantified Overall Economic Impact.

You should consider the economic impact of all possible decisions when you have to make a project decision. For example, choosing between releasing a project soon without many tests or testing more and releasing later should be an economic, not a philosophical choice.

### E3: The Principle of Quantified Cost of Delay If You only Quantify One Thing, Quantify the Cost of Delay.

You don't have business trading money for [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time) if you don't know the economic value of [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time). No single sensitivity is more eye-opening than the cost of delay (COD). The cost of queues, determined by COD, dominates the economics of Flow.

## Managing Queues

### Q1: The Principle of Invisible Inventory: Product Development Inventory Is Physically and Financially Invisible.

Inventory in product development isn't physical objects but information. Then, it's virtually invisible, both physically and financially. Product development inventory's effects: increased [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time), delayed feedback, constantly shifting priorities, and status reporting.

## Achieving Decentralized Control

### D1: The Second Perishability Principle: Decentralize Control for Problems and Opportunities that Age Poorly.

Certain problems and opportunities are highly perishable, requiring swift action—like putting out a fire before it spreads. On the other hand, some issues, like a bad stock investment, have self-limiting impacts.

To handle problems that worsen over time or seize fleeting opportunities, decentralize control. This means empowering individuals with the authority and resources to act quickly. Centralized planning can set tasks, but decentralized control ensures flexibility, enabling immediate responses to minor issues without delays.

### D2: The Scale Principle: Centralize Control for Problems that Are Infrequent, Large, or Have Significant Economies of Scale.

Some problems require large-scale responses—big fires need fire trucks, not garden hoses. Centralized control is ideal for infrequent but significant demands, especially when economies of scale are at play. In contrast, frequent, small, and low-variability issues are better handled by decentralized resources ([D1: The Second Perishability Principle](#d1-the-second-perishability-principle-decentralize-control-for-problems-and-opportunities-that-age-poorly)).

Centralizing resources can delay response due to their size and complexity, so prioritizing these resources is crucial to ensure timely action. In product development, instead of placing an expert on every project, centralizing their expertise can be more efficient.

### D7: The Principle of Alignment: More Value Is Created with Overall Alignment than Local Excellence

While one barbarian might defeat a Roman soldier, 1,000 Roman soldiers would always overcome 1,000 barbarians due to superior coordination and alignment of their forces.

In war, the principle of mass refers to concentrating effort and resources on a decisive point to achieve maximum impact. Economy of force means allocating minimal resources to secondary tasks, ensuring most resources are focused on the main objective. Together, these principles demonstrate the power of alignment.

In product development, small gains across many features don't impress, but a significant advantage in a key area can sway customer preference. Aligning resources to focus on a single area can create a competitive advantage, even if it means sacrificing excellence in other areas.

### D8: The Principle of Mission: Specify the End State, Its Purpose, and the Minimal Possible Constraints

In maneuver warfare, missions align teams through mission orders, which focus on the operation’s intent—its end state—rather than prescribing specific actions. They communicate the "why," not the "what" or "how."

When the intent is clear, those executing the mission can adapt to obstacles or opportunities, choosing the best course of action. A well-crafted mission statement is a powerful tool for maintaining coordination, with the "why" being its most crucial element.

For example, in product development, rather than prescribing detailed features, a mission might be "create a seamless user experience that reduces churn by 20%." The team is free to explore the best solutions to achieve this goal, whether through UX improvements, better onboarding, or new product features. The key is the clear end state (reduce churn) and its purpose (improve retention), with minimal constraints on how to achieve it.
