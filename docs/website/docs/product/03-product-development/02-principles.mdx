In this section, we list the principles that we follow when developing products. We use these principles as a base to create all processes, tools, guidelines, and workflows of all departments—[product](/docs/product), [design](/docs/engineering), and [engineering](/docs/engineering).

_We based on the book [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B00K7OWG7O) by Donald G. Reinertsen._

## The Economic View

_Why do you want to change the product development process?_ The answer: **to increase profits**.

The economic view of product development allows you to make product development decisions based on economic choices. You don't chase the popular proxy variable of the moment. Instead, you transform all proxy variables to the same unit of measure, life-cycle profits, and make multivariable trade-offs to increase profits, which is the core of product development.

### E1: The Principle of Quantified Overall Economics: Select Actions Based on Quantified Overall Economic Impact.

You should consider the economic impact of all possible decisions when you have to make a project decision. For example, choosing between releasing a project soon without many tests or testing more and releasing later should be an economic, not a philosophical choice.

### E3: The Principle of Quantified Cost of Delay If You only Quantify One Thing, Quantify the Cost of Delay.

You don't have business trading money for [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time) if you don't know the economic value of [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time). No single sensitivity is more eye-opening than the cost of delay (COD). The cost of queues, determined by COD, dominates the economics of Flow.

## Managing Queues

### Q1: The Principle of Invisible Inventory: Product Development Inventory Is Physically and Financially Invisible.

Inventory in product development isn't physical objects but information. Then, it's virtually invisible, both physically and financially. Product development inventory's effects: increased [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time), delayed feedback, constantly shifting priorities, and status reporting.

## Achieving Decentralized Control

### D1: The Second Perishability Principle: Decentralize Control for Problems and Opportunities that Age Poorly.

Certain problems and opportunities are highly perishable, requiring swift action—like putting out a fire before it spreads. On the other hand, some issues, like a bad stock investment, have self-limiting impacts.

To handle problems that worsen over time or seize fleeting opportunities, decentralize control. This means empowering individuals with the authority and resources to act quickly. Centralized planning can set tasks, but decentralized control ensures flexibility, enabling immediate responses to minor issues without delays.

### D2: The Scale Principle: Centralize Control for Problems that Are Infrequent, Large, or Have Significant Economies of Scale.

Some problems require large-scale responses—big fires need fire trucks, not garden hoses. Centralized control is ideal for infrequent but significant demands, especially when economies of scale are at play. In contrast, frequent, small, and low-variability issues are better handled by decentralized resources ([D1: The Second Perishability Principle](#d1-the-second-perishability-principle-decentralize-control-for-problems-and-opportunities-that-age-poorly)).

Centralizing resources can delay response due to their size and complexity, so prioritizing these resources is crucial to ensure timely action. In product development, instead of placing an expert on every project, centralizing their expertise can be more efficient.
