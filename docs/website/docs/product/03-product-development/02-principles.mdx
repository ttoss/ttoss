In this section, we list the principles that we follow when developing products. We use these principles as a base to create all processes, tools, guidelines, and workflows of all departmentsâ€”[product](/docs/product), [design](/docs/engineering), and [engineering](/docs/engineering).

_We based on the book [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation-ebook/dp/B00K7OWG7O) by Donald G. Reinertsen._

## The Economic View

_Why do you want to change the product development process?_ The answer: **to increase profits**.

The economic view of product development allows you to make product development decisions based on economic choices. You don't chase the popular proxy variable of the moment. Instead, you transform all proxy variables to the same unit of measure, life-cycle profits, and make multivariable trade-offs to increase profits, which is the core of product development.

### E1: The Principle of Quantified Overall Economics: Select Actions Based on Quantified Overall Economic Impact.

You should consider the economic impact of all possible decisions when you have to make a project decision. For example, choosing between releasing a project soon without many tests or testing more and releasing later should be an economic, not a philosophical choice.

### E3: The Principle of Quantified Cost of Delay If You only Quantify One Thing, Quantify the Cost of Delay.

You don't have business trading money for [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time) if you don't know the economic value of [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time). No single sensitivity is more eye-opening than the cost of delay (COD). The cost of queues, determined by COD, dominates the economics of Flow.

## Managing Queues

### Q1: The Principle of Invisible Inventory: Product Development Inventory Is Physically and Financially Invisible.

Inventory in product development isn't physical objects but information. Then, it's virtually invisible, both physically and financially. Product development inventory's effects: increased [cycle time](/docs/product/product-development/definitions#cycle-time), delayed feedback, constantly shifting priorities, and status reporting.
