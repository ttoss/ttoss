title: Goals
---

The main goal of our workflow is to make it easy to apply [principles of product development](/docs/product/product-development/principles) to the entire process of building products, from conception to launch. We also aim to balance creating a flexible approach to eliminate waste on low-value tasks and allowing our team to focus on high-value and creative tasks. Because of this, we have a few goals for our workflow:

- Gives the team a clear vision of the product throughout the entire development process.
- Helps the team visualize the progress of the entire product development chain.
- Focuses on the team members, not just the managers, throughout the product development process.
- The workflow should fit all members of the cross-functional product teamâ€”product managers, designers, marketers, engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the product development process.
- Each team member has the autonomy to complete, give suggestions, and decide on the product throughout the entire development process.
- Foster collaboration and communication among team members to ensure everyone is working towards the same goals and has a shared understanding of the product and its development.
- Encourage continuous learning and improvement by regularly reviewing and refining the workflow to optimize efficiency, quality, and outcomes (kaizen).
