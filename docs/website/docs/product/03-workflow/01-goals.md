title: Goals
---

The main goal of our **product workflow** is to make it easy to apply [principles of product development](/docs/product/product-development/principles) to the entire process of building products, from conception to launch. We focus on **strategy, discovery, and definition** of what should be built, while the [engineering workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow) handles the technical implementation.

We aim to balance creating a flexible approach to eliminate waste on low-value tasks and allowing our team to focus on high-value and creative tasks. Because of this, we have a few goals for our product workflow:

- Gives the team a clear vision of the product throughout the entire development process.
- Helps the team visualize the progress of the entire product development chain.
- Focuses on the team members, not just the managers, throughout the product development process.
- The workflow should fit all members of the cross-functional product teamâ€”product managers, designers, marketers, and other stakeholders involved in the product development process.
- Each team member has the autonomy to complete, give suggestions, and decide on the product throughout the entire development process.
- Foster collaboration and communication among team members to ensure everyone is working towards the same goals and has a shared understanding of the product and its development.
- Encourage continuous learning and improvement by regularly reviewing and refining the workflow to optimize efficiency, quality, and outcomes (kaizen).

## Product vs Engineering Workflow

This **product workflow** focuses on:

- **What** to build (strategy and discovery)
- **Why** to build it (user needs and business value)
- **Requirements definition** (user stories and acceptance criteria)
- **Prioritization** (what comes first and why)

The **[engineering workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow)** focuses on:

- **How** to build it (technical implementation)
- **When** to deliver it (deployment and release)
- **Quality assurance** (testing and code review)
- **Production monitoring** (ensuring stability)

Both workflows are designed to work together seamlessly, with clear handoff points and continuous collaboration between product and engineering teams.
