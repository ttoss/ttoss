# Product Workflow

This document describes ttoss product workflow, focused on **strategy, discovery, and definition** of features that should be built. For the technical implementation process, see the [engineering workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow).

## Overview

Our product workflow is based on [product development principles](/docs/product/product-development/principles) and has the main objective of defining **what** to build and **why** to build it, ensuring we deliver real value to users.

## Workflow Structure

### 1. [Goals](./goals)

Objectives and principles that guide our product development process.

### 2. [Kanban](./kanban)

Visual system to manage workflow and task status.

### 3. [Meetings](./meetings)

Meeting structure for team alignment and communication.

### 4. [FAQ](./faq)

Frequently asked questions about the product workflow.

## Product Workflow Focus

### Strategy and Discovery

- **User research**: Understand real needs and problems
- **Market analysis**: Identify opportunities and trends
- **Goal definition**: Establish clear and measurable objectives

### Definition and Prioritization

- **User stories**: Document requirements from user perspective
- **Acceptance criteria**: Define when a feature is ready
- **Backlog management**: Organize and prioritize what will be developed

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

- **Vision alignment**: Ensure everyone understands the direction
- **Effective communication**: Facilitate information exchange between teams
- **Decision making**: Clear processes for product decisions

## Workflow Differences

| Aspect               | **Product Workflow**                   | **Engineering Workflow**               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Main Focus**       | What and why to build                  | How and when to build                  |
| **Responsibilities** | Strategy, requirements, prioritization | Implementation, deployment, monitoring |
| **Main Tools**       | ClickUp, research, analysis            | GitHub, CI/CD, technical monitoring    |
| **Deliverables**     | User stories, backlogs, roadmaps       | Code, deployments, features            |
| **Success Metrics**  | Product KPIs, user satisfaction        | Code quality, cycle time               |

## Integration Points

The workflows connect at key moments:

1. **Task handoff**: Product defines, engineering implements
2. **Technical feedback**: Engineering informs about feasibility and effort
3. **Delivery validation**: Product validates if criteria were met
4. **Joint monitoring**: Tracking product and technical metrics

## Next Steps

For product team members:

1. Start with [Goals](./goals) to understand the principles
2. Get familiar with our [Kanban system](./kanban)
3. Participate in [structured meetings](./meetings)
