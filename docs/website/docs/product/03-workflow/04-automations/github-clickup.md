## ðŸ—ƒ ClickUp

### 1 - User Story

The project's Task starts in the **User Story** on the _ClickUp_ platform.

### 2 - User Feedback

Within the main Task, there will be a **User Feedback** section dedicated to product feedbacks, which soon became a _subtasks_.

### 3 - SubTask

Once the **subtask** is created, the developer can work within it.

The **subtask** is divided into two parts, the first is the task description and the second is the chat, where the team can talk about the development of the work.

- Task description:

  - Title;
  - Detail description of what will be done in the task;
  - Evidence (images, GIF, videos etc);

- Chat:

  - Dialogue between team;
  - To tag the whole team at once, just put `@watcher` and leave a comment.

### 4 - Link ClickUp Task to GitHub

Before development begins, the task needs to be linked between **ClickUp** and **GitHub** to enable proper tracking and collaboration.

**Product team responsibilities:**

- **Ensure task clarity**: Verify that requirements and acceptance criteria are clearly defined
- **Provide GitHub integration**: Link the ClickUp task to the appropriate GitHub repository
- **Set up tracking**: Enable status synchronization between ClickUp and GitHub

**Technical implementation**: The engineering team handles the technical aspects of branch creation and repository management as described in the [Engineering Workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow).

### 5 - Task Development

Once the task is defined and linked between **ClickUp** and **GitHub**, the development team follows the [engineering workflow](/docs/engineering/workflow) to implement the solution.

**Product responsibilities during development:**

- **Monitor progress**: Track task status through ClickUp
- **Provide clarifications**: Answer questions about requirements when needed
- **Review deliverables**: Validate that acceptance criteria are met
- **Test staging environment**: Use staging links to validate functionality
- **Approve completion**: Confirm task meets product requirements before deployment

**For technical implementation details**, see the [Engineering Development Process](/docs/engineering/workflow/development-process).
