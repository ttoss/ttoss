# Modules

**ttoss** (Terezinha Tech Operations) provides this library of modular solutions designed to enhance your product development process. These reusable [packages](/docs/modules/packages) simplify common challenges, allowing development teams to focus on delivering high-impact features efficiently.

These libraries are built in accordance with the technologies defined by our engineering department. For more information on these standards, please refer to [the Engineering technologies](/docs/engineering/technologies).

## Context-Based Integration

A key engineering feature of ttoss packages is the **context-based architecture**. Instead of passing configuration through props at every level, you configure your application once at the root (theme, translations, notifications), and all ttoss packages automatically adapt.

This eliminates prop drilling, reduces boilerplate, and ensures consistency across all packages. Learn more about [Integration Architecture](/docs/modules/integration-architecture).

## Additional Resources

In addition to these modules, **ttoss** includes documentation on the operational processes involved in digital product development. This covers best practices and guidelines for [product management](/docs/product), [engineering](/docs/engineering), and [design](/docs/engineering) departments.

To learn more about the motivation behind the creation of these modules, read our blog article: [Enabling Agile Product Development with ttoss: A Modular Approach](/blog/2024/10/01/enabling-agile-product-development-with-ttoss-a-modular-approach).

Explore the [packages](/docs/modules/packages) to enhance your development workflow and leverage the benefits of modular design in your projects.
