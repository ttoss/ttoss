# Modules

**ttoss** (Terezinha Tech Operations) provides this library of modular solutions designed to enhance your product development process. These reusable [packages](/docs/modules/packages) simplify common challenges, allowing development teams to focus on delivering high-impact features efficiently.

These libraries are built in accordance with the technologies defined by our engineering department. For more information on these standards, please refer to [the Engineering technologies](/docs/engineering/technologies).

## Additional Resources

In addition to these modules, **ttoss** includes documentation on the operational processes involved in digital product development. This covers best practices and guidelines for [product management](/docs/product), [engineering](/docs/engineering), and [design](/docs/engineering) departments.
