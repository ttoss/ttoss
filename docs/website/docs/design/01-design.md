# Design at ttoss

We're open sourcing our design department to share how we approach design and build digital products that scale.

## What You'll Find Here

- **[Design System](/docs/design/design-system)**: Our comprehensive design system with tokens, components, and guidelines
- **Design Principles**: Core principles that guide our design decisions
- **Resources**: Tools, guides, and best practices for designers and developers
- **Examples**: Real-world implementations and usage patterns

## Our Design Philosophy

**Design as Code**: We treat design decisions as code - versioned, documented, and systematically applied across all products.

**Progressive Enhancement**: Start with solid foundations (tokens) and build up to complex components and patterns.

**Accessibility First**: Every design decision considers accessibility from the ground up, not as an afterthought.

## Quick Start

New to our design system? Start with:

1. **[Getting Started Guide](/docs/design/getting-started)** - Set up and basic usage
2. **[Design Tokens](/docs/design/design-system/design-tokens)** - Understanding our design foundation
3. **[Storybook](https://storybook.ttoss.dev)** - Interactive component explorer

## Contributing

Our design system evolves through:

- **Community feedback** and real-world usage patterns
- **Cross-team collaboration** between design and engineering
- **Continuous iteration** based on user needs and technical constraints
