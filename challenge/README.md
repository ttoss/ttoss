## Project: The Best YouTube Video of All Time

Your challenge is to build an engaging web application to determine the best YouTube video of all time. The core functionality involves presenting users with two videos at a time, where they must choose their favorite. The system will then use the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to rank the videos based on these choices.

**The essential feature of the application is a voting page where users can compare two videos and a ranking page to view the current standings**.

### Additional Features

While the essential feature is critical, consider implementing the following enhancements to create a richer experience:

- **User Authentication**: Allow authenticated users to add new videos to the system.
- **Ranking Pagination**: Add pagination to the ranking page for better usability.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Make the ranking page dynamic by updating it in real time.
- **Video Details**: Provide a detailed view of each video, including metadata such as title, description, and upload date.
