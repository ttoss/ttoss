## Project: The Best YouTube Video of All Time

You have to build a web application to find out what is the best YouTube video of all time. The application shows two videos at a time and the user has to choose which one they like the most. The system will then use this information to rank the videos using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

**The essential feature of the application is a page to vote and see the ranking of the videos**.

Besides the essential feature, the application can have other features, such as:

- A feature to add new videos to the system with user authentication.
- Pagination of the ranking page.
- Updatable ranking page in real-time.
- A feature to see the details of a video.

Check the requirements below of each department for more details.
